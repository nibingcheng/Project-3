## Getting Started

Our Breweries Home Page can provide the end _USER_ with the Name, Address, City, and State for any Brewery within your Search criteria. It also includes a location map.

### Current Features

Our Current Features allow user to search by `_City_`, `_State`_, and to filter the results by `_Type_`.  These features are described below. 

### `Search by CITY`

To do a search by `CITY`, the user can select the respective city that they would like to find the local breweries. An Example may be _Ankeny_ or _San Diego_. Input text for searching can be submitted by either pressing the ENTER key or clicking the submit button.

### `Search by STATE`

To search by `STATE`, they can select the respective STATE that they would like to find the breweries. An Example may be _Iowa_ or _California_. Input text for searching can be submitted by either pressing the ENTER key or clicking the submit button.

### `Filter the result`

The app provides the capability of filtering the search result by `TYPE`. A user can select the respective brewery TYPE that they would like to find in that specific city or state. An Example may be _nano_ or _regional_ or _micro_.

`micro` - Most craft breweries are considered a micro brewery.
<br/>
`nano` - Extremely small brewery which typically only distributes locally.
<br/>
`regional` - A regional location of an an expanded brewery. Ex. Sierra Nevada's Asheville, NC Location.
<br/>
`large` - A very large brewery. Ex. Miller-Coors. 

- After a search request is submitted, the app returns a full list of brewery names. By default all the filter checkboxes are
not ticked. 
  
- If any number of the checkboxes are selected, the page will only show a subset of the results that meets the selection request. 
  
- Full results are shown if all or none of the checkboxes are selected.
  
- The results are dynamically refreshed. An example would be that if `micro` is selected after which another `TYPE` is checked,the content would update upon each request submission.
